Open Source by McKinsey is our ecosystem of digital and analytics projects we're excited to share with the world. We recognize that open source has become a foundational element of delivering organizational transformation for our clients globally. It is also our way to contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth and to narrow the digital divide. 

Currently, all of our open-source work is created in [McKinsey Digital](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/how-we-help-clients), the home for our work in digital and analytics. 

This part of McKinsey houses: 

 - [QuantumBlack, AI by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/how-we-help-clients), where we unlock the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to help organizations reinvent themselves from the ground up.
 - [McKinsey Technology](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/mckinsey-technology/overview), the home for our capabilities that help us partner with clients to modernize their technology stacks and accelerate impact using Cloud by McKinsey, Agile Delivery, Data Transformation and more
 - [Leap by McKinsey](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/mckinsey-technology/overview), where we work with established organizations to imagine, build, and scale new businesses


## Our project ecosystem

We believe in the power of open source and are excited to contribute to the community. 

Our open-source projects include:

  - [Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) - A toolbox for production-ready data science. It uses software engineering best practices to help you create data engineering and data science pipelines that are reproducible, maintainable, and modular. Kedro was donated to the Linux Foundation's AI & Data Incubator to become an open standard in machine-learning engineering.
  - [MLRun](https://github.com/mlrun/mlrun) - An open MLOps platform for quickly building and managing continuous ML applications across their lifecycle. MLRun integrates into your development and CI/CD environment and automates the delivery of production data, ML pipelines, and online applications, significantly reducing engineering efforts, time to production, and computation resources.
  - [Nuclio](https://github.com/nuclio/nuclio) - A high-performance "serverless" framework focused on data, I/O, and compute-intensive workloads. It integrates with popular data science tools, such as Jupyter and Kubeflow, supports a variety of data and streaming sources, and can be executed over CPUs and GPUs.
  - [Vizro](https://github.com/mckinsey/vizro) - An open-source Python toolkit for creating modular data visualization applications. It creates customised dashboards in minutes - without the need for advanced coding or design experience - to create flexible and scalable, Python-enabled data visualization applications.
  - [CausalNex](https://github.com/mckinsey/causalnex) - An open-source Python library for causal reasoning and "what-if" analysis using Bayesian networks. It provides tools to learn causal structures from data, allow experts to augment the relationships, and estimate the effects of potential interventions.
  - [QBStyles](https://github.com/mckinsey/qbstyles) - A Python package with light and dark Matplotlib styles.

We invite you to explore these projects, join in the development, and recommend new initiatives! Together, we can drive open innovation.
